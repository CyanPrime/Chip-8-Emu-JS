<b>This Chip 8 emulator was coded in JavaScript by CyanPrime</b>

<p>My Chip 8 emulator will play most chip 8 games perfectly, and allows you to drag 
and drop your ROM files right into the Drop Area of the emulator page and begin 
playing right away. It also has a custom control system, since playing Chip 8 
games on a keyboard using the default chip 8 Layout can highly vary in comfort.</p>
